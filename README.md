# Algo-Trading

# Introduction
This project is aimed at implementing the day & night trading strategy on stocks data. The strategy involves buying a stock at the end of the trading day and selling it at the start of the next trading day. It is a simple trading strategy that has the potential for high returns if implemented correctly. This project includes code to backtest the strategy on Amazon and Apple stock data.
